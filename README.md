# Lululemon Men's Pants Dashboard

## Project Description

As a former Educator (Sales Associate) at Lululemon, I've spent a lot of time getting to know the various products the company has on offer. I attended multiple trainings to learn about product designs and features and was able to further my product knowledge by listening to the needs of customers. At a certain point, however, I felt that I was not learning and was simply repeating the same sales pitch to all customers. I have thus created the following dashboard in order to provide fellow Educators with a tool to quickly analyze data related to mens pants. The visuals are built on ~20k product reviews collected on March 16, 2023 and provide high level insights about product data and reviews.

## Getting Started

Click [here](https://lululemon-mens-pants-dash.onrender.com/) to interact with the dashboard. Please note it may take a couple minutes for this page and data to load.

## Layout and Instructions

### Section 1: General Overview

This section provides a general overview of the number of products and reviews based on different categories. The user can select from Product Family/Design/Fabric for the variable on the x-axis and count will be displayed on the y-axis. Please note the use of a logged scale in the first bar chart because a majority to the reviews tend to focus on the most popular products.

### Section 2: Product Rating Analysis

This section provides a more in-depth look into the star-ratings provided by users for each product. The user can select from the same category options as in Section 1 along with a date range slider in order to create a stacked bar chart and a line chart. The stacked bar chart shows the districution of ratings for each level (1-5) while the line chart shows the average at each point in time. Users can change the date range to get a better idea of when specific products were introduced and how the ratings have changed over time. Users can also click elements in the legend to either include/exclude elements from the charts. 

### Section 3: Review Text Analysis

This section allows the user to analyze text provided in product reviews. The user should select an overall category, specific Family/Design/Fabric element, and a number of words to include in the n-gram (1, 2, or 3). This will create two word clouds with the most popular word(s) to appear for that specific combination of variables, with the first showing text of negative reviews and the second showing text of positive reviews. 

## Conclusion

This dashboard will enable Educators to quickly gather insights about Lululemon men's pants from product data and reviews.
